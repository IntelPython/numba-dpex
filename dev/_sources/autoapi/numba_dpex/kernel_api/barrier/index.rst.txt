numba_dpex.kernel_api.barrier
=============================

.. py:module:: numba_dpex.kernel_api.barrier

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Python functions that simulate SYCL's group_barrier function.



Overview
--------


.. list-table:: Function
   :header-rows: 0
   :widths: auto
   :class: summarytable

   * - :py:obj:`group_barrier <numba_dpex.kernel_api.barrier.group_barrier>`\ (group, fence_scope)
     - Performs a barrier operation across all work-items in a work group.




Functions
---------
.. py:function:: group_barrier(group: numba_dpex.kernel_api.index_space_ids.Group, fence_scope=MemoryScope.WORK_GROUP)

   Performs a barrier operation across all work-items in a work group.

   The function is modeled after the ``sycl::group_barrier`` function. It
   synchronizes work within a group of work items. All the work-items
   of the group must execute the barrier call before any work-item
   continues execution beyond the barrier.

   The ``group_barrier`` performs mem-fence operations ensuring that memory
   accesses issued before the barrier are not re-ordered with those issued
   after the barrier: all work-items in group G execute a release fence prior
   to synchronizing at the barrier, all work-items in group G execute an
   acquire fence afterwards, and there is an implicit synchronization of these
   fences as if provided by an explicit atomic operation on an atomic object.
