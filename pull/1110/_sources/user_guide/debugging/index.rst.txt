Debugging with Intel® Distribution for GDB*
===========================================

Numba-dpex allows you to debug SYCL* kernels with Intel® Distribution for GDB*.
To enable the emission of debug information, set the debug environment variable
:envvar:`NUMBA_DPEX_DEBUGINFO`, for example:
:samp:`export NUMBA_DPEX_DEBUGINFO=1`
To disable debugging, unset the variable:
:samp:`unset NUMBA_DPEX_DEBUGINFO`

.. note::

    Enabling debug information significantly increases the memory consumption
    for each compiled kernel. For a large application, this may cause
    out-of-memory error.

Not all debugging features supported by Numba on CPUs are yet supported by
numba-dpex. See :ref:`debugging-features-and-limitations`.

Requirements
------------

`Intel® Distribution for GDB*` is required for numba-dpex debugging features to
work.
`Intel® Distribution for GDB*` is part of `Intel oneAPI`. For relevant
documentation, refer to the `Intel® Distribution for GDB* product page`_.

Example of Intel® Distribution for GDB* usage
---------------------------------------------

You can use a sample kernel code, :file:`simple_sum.py`, for basic debugging:

.. literalinclude:: ./../../../../numba_dpex/examples/debug/simple_sum.py
    :lines: 5-
    :linenos:
    :lineno-match:

Use the following commands to create a breakpoint inside the kernel and run the
debugger:

.. literalinclude:: ./../../../../numba_dpex/examples/debug/commands/docs/simple_sum
    :language: shell-session
