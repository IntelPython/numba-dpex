==========================================

.. py:module:: numba_dpex.kernel_api.atomic_ref

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Implements a mock Python class to represent ``sycl::atomic_ref`` for
   prototyping numba_dpex kernel functions before they are JIT compiled.

   * - :py:obj:`AtomicRef <numba_dpex.kernel_api.atomic_ref.AtomicRef>`
     - Analogue to the ``sycl::atomic_ref`` type. An atomic reference is a





.. py:class:: AtomicRef(ref, index=0, memory_order=MemoryOrder.RELAXED, memory_scope=MemoryScope.DEVICE, address_space=AddressSpace.GLOBAL)


   Analogue to the ``sycl::atomic_ref`` type. An atomic reference is a
   view into a data container that can be then updated atomically using any of
   the ``fetch_*`` member functions of the class.

   .. py:property:: ref

      Returns the value stored in the AtomicRef._ref[_index].

   .. py:property:: memory_order
      :type: numba_dpex.kernel_api.memory_enums.MemoryOrder

      Returns the MemoryOrder value used to define the AtomicRef.

   .. py:property:: memory_scope
      :type: numba_dpex.kernel_api.memory_enums.MemoryScope

      Returns the MemoryScope value used to define the AtomicRef.

   .. py:property:: address_space
      :type: numba_dpex.kernel_api.memory_enums.AddressSpace

      Returns the AddressSpace value used to define the AtomicRef.

   .. py:method:: fetch_add(val)

      Adds the operand ``val`` to the object referenced by the AtomicRef
      and assigns the result to the value of the referenced object. Returns
      the original value of the object.

      :param val: Value to be added to the object referenced by the AtomicRef.

      Returns: The original value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.



   .. py:method:: fetch_sub(val)

      Subtracts the operand ``val`` to the object referenced by the
      AtomicRef and assigns the result to the value of the referenced object.
      Returns the original value of the object.

      :param val: Value to be subtracted from the object referenced by the
      :param AtomicRef.:

      Returns: The original value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.



   .. py:method:: fetch_min(val)

      Calculates the minimum value of the operand ``val`` and the object
      referenced by the AtomicRef and assigns the result to the value of the
      referenced object. Returns the original value of the object.

      :param val: Value to be compared against the object referenced by the
      :param AtomicRef.:

      Returns: The original value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.



   .. py:method:: fetch_max(val)

      Calculates the maximum value of the operand ``val`` and the object
      referenced by the AtomicRef and assigns the result to the value of the
      referenced object. Returns the original value of the object.

      :param val: Value to be compared against the object referenced by the
      :param AtomicRef.:

      Returns: The original value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.



   .. py:method:: fetch_and(val)

      Calculates the bitwise AND of the operand ``val`` and the object
      referenced by the AtomicRef and assigns the result to the value of the
      referenced object. Returns the original value of the object.

      :param val: Value to be bitwise ANDed against the object referenced by
      :param the AtomicRef.:

      Returns: The original value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.



   .. py:method:: fetch_or(val)

      Calculates the bitwise OR of the operand ``val`` and the object
      referenced by the AtomicRef and assigns the result to the value of the
      referenced object. Returns the original value of the object.

      :param val: Value to be bitwise ORed against the object referenced by
      :param the AtomicRef.:

      Returns: The original value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.



   .. py:method:: fetch_xor(val)

      Calculates the bitwise XOR of the operand ``val`` and the object
      referenced by the AtomicRef and assigns the result to the value of the
      referenced object. Returns the original value of the object.

      :param val: Value to be bitwise XORed against the object referenced by
      :param the AtomicRef.:

      Returns: The original value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.



   .. py:method:: load()

      Loads the value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.

      Returns: The value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.



   .. py:method:: store(val)

      Stores operand ``val`` to the object referenced by the AtomicRef.

      :param val: Value to be stored in the object referenced by
      :param the AtomicRef.:


   .. py:method:: exchange(val)

      Replaces the value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef
      with value of ``val``. Returns the original value of the referenced object.

      :param val: Value to be exchanged against the object referenced by
      :param the AtomicRef.:

      Returns: The original value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef.



   .. py:method:: compare_exchange(expected, desired, expected_idx=0)

      Compares the value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef
      against the value of ``expected[expected_idx]``.
      If the values are equal, replaces the value of the
      referenced object with the value of ``desired``.
      Otherwise assigns the original value of the
      referenced object to ``expected[expected_idx]``.

      :param expected: Array containing the expected value of the
      :param object referenced by the AtomicRef.:
      :param desired: Value that replaces the value of the object
      :param referenced by the AtomicRef.:
      :param expected_idx: Offset in `expected` array where the expected
      :param value of the object referenced by the AtomicRef is present.:

      Returns: Returns ``True`` if the comparison operation and
      replacement operation were successful.
