Functions
---------
.. py:function:: device_func(func_or_sig=None, **options)

   Generates a function with a device-only calling convention, e.g.,
   spir_func for SPIR-V based devices.

   The decorator is used to compile overloads in the DpexKernelTarget and
   users should use the decorator to define functions that are only callable
   from inside another device_func or a kernel.

   A device_func is not compiled down to device binary IR and instead left as
   LLVM IR. It is done so that the function can be inlined fully into the
   kernel module from where it is used at the LLVM level, leading to more
   optimization opportunities.

   :returns: A KernelDispatcher instance with the
             _compilation_mode option set to DEVICE_FUNC.
   :rtype: KernelDispatcher


.. py:function:: kernel(func_or_sig=None, **options)

   A decorator to define a kernel function.

   A kernel function is conceptually equivalent to a SYCL kernel function, and
   gets compiled into either an OpenCL or a LevelZero SPIR-V binary kernel.
   A kernel decorated Python function has the following restrictions:

       * The function can not return any value.
       * All array arguments passed to a kernel should adhere to compute
         follows data programming model.


.. py:function:: call_kernel(kernel_fn, index_space, *kernel_args) -> None

   Compiles and synchronously executes a kernel function.

   Kernel execution happens in synchronous way, so the main thread will be
   blocked till the kernel done execution.

   :param kernel_fn: A
                     :func:`numba_dpex.experimental.kernel` decorated function that is
                     compiled to a ``KernelDispatcher``.
   :type kernel_fn: numba_dpex.experimental.KernelDispatcher
   :param index_space: A Range or NdRange type object that
                       specifies the index space for the kernel.
   :type index_space: Range | NdRange
   :param kernel_args: List of objects that are passed to the numba_dpex.kernel
                       decorated function.


.. py:function:: call_kernel_async(kernel_fn, index_space, dependent_events: list[dpctl.SyclEvent], *kernel_args) -> tuple[dpctl.SyclEvent, dpctl.SyclEvent]

   Compiles and asynchronously executes a kernel function.

   Calls a :func:`numba_dpex.experimental.kernel` decorated function
   asynchronously from CPython or from a :func:`numba_dpex.dpjit` function. As
   the kernel execution happens asynchronously, so the main thread will not be
   blocked till the kernel done execution. Instead the function returns back to
   caller a handle for an *event* to track kernel execution. It is a user's
   responsibility to properly track kernel execution completion and not use any
   data that may still be used by the kernel prior to the kernel's completion.

   :param kernel_fn: A
                     :func:`numba_dpex.experimental.kernel` decorated function that is
                     compiled to a ``KernelDispatcher``.
   :type kernel_fn: KernelDispatcher
   :param index_space: A Range or NdRange type object that
                       specifies the index space for the kernel.
   :type index_space: Range | NdRange
   :param kernel_args: List of objects that are passed to the numba_dpex.kernel
                       decorated function.

   :returns: A pair of ``dpctl.SyclEvent`` objects. The pair of events constitute of
             a host task and an event associated with the kernel execution. The event
             associated with the kernel execution indicates the execution status of
             the submitted kernel function. The host task manages the lifetime of any
             PyObject passed in as a kernel argument and automatically decrements the
             reference count of the object on kernel execution completion.
