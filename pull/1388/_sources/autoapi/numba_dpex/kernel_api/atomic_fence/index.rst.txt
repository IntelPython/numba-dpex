   :header-rows: 0
   :widths: auto
   :class: summarytable

   * - :py:obj:`atomic_fence <numba_dpex.kernel_api.atomic_fence.atomic_fence>`\ (memory_order, memory_scope)
     - The function for performing memory fence across all work-items.




Functions
---------
.. py:function:: atomic_fence(memory_order, memory_scope)

   The function for performing memory fence across all work-items.
   Modeled after ``sycl::atomic_fence`` function.
   It provides control over re-ordering of memory load
   and store operations. The ``atomic_fence`` function acts as a
   fence across all work-items and devices specified by a
   memory_scope argument.

   Args:
   memory_order: The memory synchronization order.

   memory_scope: The set of work-items and devices to which
   the memory ordering constraints apply.
