A *range* kernel represents the simplest form of parallelism that can be
expressed in numba-dpex using kapi. Such a kernel represents a data-parallel
execution over a set of work items with each work item representing a logical
thread of execution. :ref:`ex_vecadd_kernel` shows an example of a range kernel
written in numba-dpex.

    :name: ex_vecadd_kernel
    :emphasize-lines: 9,17

    import dpnp
    import numba_dpex.experimental as dpex
    from numba_dpex import kernel_api as kapi


    # Data parallel kernel implementing vector sum
    @dpex.kernel
    def vecadd(item: kapi.Item, a, b, c):
        i = item.get_id(0)
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i]


    N = 1024
    a = dpnp.ones(N)
    b = dpnp.ones_like(a)
    c = dpnp.zeros_like(a)
    dpex.call_kernel(vecadd, kapi.Range(N), a, b, c)

The highlighted lines in the example demonstrate the definition of the execution
range on **line 17** and extraction of every work items' *id* or index position
via the ``item.get_id`` call on **line 10**. An execution range comprising of
1024 work items is defined when calling the kernel and each work item then
executes a single addition. Note that the array sizes for the input and output
arguments are equal to the size of the execution range. For very large arrays,
the design will not scale as there is usually an upper bound for the range size
depending on device. For most current Intel GPU devices, the maximum range size
is 2^32 and a kernel requesting more work items than that bound will not
execute. As such, programmers need to consider the size of the data and the
access patterns for their kernels before scheduling a range kernel. The maximum
number of work items can be queried programmatically as shown in
:ref:`ex_max_work_item`.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :caption: **Example:** Query maximum number of work items for a device
    :name: ex_max_work_item

    import dpctl
    import math

    d = dpctl.SyclDevice("gpu")
    d.print_device_info()

    max_num_work_items = (
        d.max_work_group_size
        * d.max_work_item_sizes1d[0]
        * d.max_work_item_sizes2d[0]
        * d.max_work_item_sizes3d[0]
    )
    print(max_num_work_items, f"(2^{int(math.log(max_num_work_items, 2))})")

    cpud = dpctl.SyclDevice("cpu")
    cpud.print_device_info()

    max_num_work_items_cpu = (
        cpud.max_work_group_size
        * cpud.max_work_item_sizes1d[0]
        * cpud.max_work_item_sizes2d[0]
        * cpud.max_work_item_sizes3d[0]
    )
    print(max_num_work_items_cpu, f"(2^{int(math.log(max_num_work_items_cpu, 2))})")

graphics processor and a 9th Generation Coffee Lake CPU is shown in

There are a few semantic rules that have to be adhered to when writing a range
kernel:

* Analogous to the API of SYCL a range kernel can execute only over a 1-, 2-, or
  a 3-dimensional set of work items.

* Every range kernel requires its first argument to be an instance of the
  :class:`numba_dpex.kernel_api.Item` class. The ``Item`` object is an
  abstraction encapsulating the index position (id) of a single work item in the
  global execution range. The id will be a 1-, 2-, or a 3-tuple depending
  the dimensionality of the execution range.

* A range kernel cannot return any value.

  **Note** the rule is enforced only in
  the compiled mode and not in the pure Python execution on a kapi kernel.

* A kernel can accept both array and scalar arguments. Array arguments currently
  can either be a ``dpnp.ndarray`` or a ``dpctl.tensor.usm_ndarray``. Scalar
  values can be of any Python numeric type. Array arguments are passed by
  reference, *i.e.*, changes to an array in a kernel are visible outside the
  kernel. Scalar values are always passed by value.

* At least one argument of a kernel should be an array. The requirement is so
  that the kernel launcher (:func:`numba_dpex.experimental.call_kernel`) can
  determine the execution queue on which to launch the kernel. Refer
  the :ref:`launching-a-kernel` section for more details.

A range kernel has to be executed via the
:py:func:`numba_dpex.experimental.launcher.call_kernel` function by passing in
an instance of the :class:`numba_dpex.kernel_api.Range` class. Refer the
:ref:`launching-a-kernel` section for more details on how to launch a range
kernel.

A range kernel is meant to express a basic `parallel-for` calculation that is
ideally suited for embarrassingly parallel kernels such as elementwise
computations over n-dimensional arrays (ndarrays). The API for expressing a
range kernel does not allow advanced features such as synchronization of work
items and fine-grained control over memory allocation on a device. For such
advanced features, an nd-range kernel should be used.
