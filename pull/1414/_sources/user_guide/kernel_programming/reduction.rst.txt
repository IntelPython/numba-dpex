Reduction on SYCL-supported Devices
===================================

Numba-dpex does not yet provide any specific decorator to implement
reduction kernels. However, a kernel reduction can be written explicitly. This
section provides two approaches for writing a reduction kernel as a
``numba_dpex.kernel`` function.


Example 1
---------

This example demonstrates a summation reduction on a one-dimensional array.

Full example can be found at ``numba_dpex/examples/sum_reduction.py``.

In this example, to reduce the array we invoke the kernel multiple times.

.. literalinclude:: ./../../../../numba_dpex/examples/sum_reduction.py
   :pyobject: sum_reduction_kernel

.. literalinclude:: ./../../../../numba_dpex/examples/sum_reduction.py
   :pyobject: sum_reduce

Example 2
---------

Full example can be found at
``numba_dpex/examples/sum_reduction_recursive_ocl.py``.

.. literalinclude:: ./../../../../numba_dpex/examples/kernel/sum_reduction_recursive_ocl.py
   :pyobject: sum_reduction_kernel

.. literalinclude:: ./../../../../numba_dpex/examples/kernel/sum_reduction_recursive_ocl.py
   :pyobject: sum_recursive_reduction

.. literalinclude:: ./../../../../numba_dpex/examples/kernel/sum_reduction_recursive_ocl.py
   :pyobject: sum_reduce

.. note::

    Numba-dpex does not yet provide any analogue to the ``numba.cuda.reduce``
    decorator for writing reductions kernel. Such a decorator will be added in
    future releases.
