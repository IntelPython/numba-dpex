Debugging with GDB
==================

Numba-dppy allows SYCL kernels to be debugged with the GDB debugger.
Setting the debug environment variable :envvar:`NUMBA_DPPY_DEBUGINFO`
(e.g. :samp:`export NUMBA_DPPY_DEBUGINFO=1`) enables the emission of debug information.
To disable debugging, unset the variable (e.g. :samp:`unset NUMBA_DPPY_DEBUGINFO`).

.. note::

    Beware that enabling debug info significantly increases the memory consumption for each compiled kernel.
    For large application, this may cause out-of-memory error.

Not all GDB features supported by Numba on CPUs are yet supported in Numba-dppy.
See :ref:`debugging-features-and-limitations`.


Requirements
------------

`Intel速 Distribution for GDB` is required for Numba-dppy's debugging features to work.
`Intel速 Distribution for GDB` is part of `Intel oneAPI` and
the relevant documentation can be found at `Intel速 Distribution for GDB documentation`_.

Example of GDB usage
--------------------

For example, given the following Numba-dppy kernel code (:file:`simple_sum.py`):

.. literalinclude:: ../../../numba_dppy/examples/debug/simple_sum.py
    :lines: 15-
    :linenos:
    :lineno-match:

Running GDB and creating breakpoint in kernel:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../numba_dppy/examples/debug/commands/docs/simple_sum
    :language: shell-session
