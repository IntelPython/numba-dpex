Common issues and tips
======================

Breakpoints are not hit
-----------------------
If the breakpoint is not hit, you will see the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    ...
    intelgt: gdbserver-gt failed to start.  Check if igfxdcd is installed, or use
    env variable INTELGT_AUTO_ATTACH_DISABLE=1 to disable auto-attach.
    ...

See the :ref:`debugging-machine-dcd-driver`.

Debugging is not stable
-----------------------

Debug features depend heavily on optimization level.
At full optimization (equivalent to O3), most of the variables are optimized out.
It is recommended to debug at "no optimization" level via :envvar:`NUMBA_OPT` (e.g. :samp:`export NUMBA_OPT=0`).
For more information refer to the Numba documentation `Debugging JIT compiled code with GDB`_.

It is possible to enable debug mode for the full application by setting the environment variable ``NUMBA_DPPY_DEBUGINFO=1``
instead of ``debug`` option inside the ``dppy.kernel`` decorator. This sets the default value of the debug option in
``dppy.kernel``. If ``NUMBA_DPPY_DEBUGINFO`` is set to a non-zero value, the debug data is emitted for the full application.
Debug mode can be turned off on individual functions by setting ``debug=False`` in ``dppy.kernel``.

Breakpoint is hit twice
-----------------------

The first line of the kernel and functions is hit twice.
This happens because you are debugging a multi-threaded program, so multiple events may be received from different threads.
This is the default behavior, but you can configure it for more efficient debugging.
To ensure the current thread executes a single line without interference, activate the scheduler-locking setting.

See :ref:`single_stepping`.
