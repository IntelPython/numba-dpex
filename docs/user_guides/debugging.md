## Debugging With GDB

`numba-dppy` allows SYCL kernels to be debugged with the GDB debugger.
Setting the debug environment variable `NUMBA_DPPY_DEBUG` (e.g.
`export NUMBA_DPPY_DEBUG=True`) enables the emission of debug information.
To disable debugging, unset the variable, *i.e*, `export NUMBA_DPPY_DEBUG= `.

Not all GDB features supported by Numba on CPUs are yet supported in `numba-dppy`.
Currently, the following debugging features are available:
- Source location (filename and line number).
- Setting break points by the line number.
- Stepping over break points.

**Note**
Debug features depend heavily on optimization level. At full optimization (equivalent to O3),
most of the variables are optimized out.
It is recommended to debug at "no optimization" level (e.g. `NUMBA_OPT=0`).
For more information refer to the Numba documentation:
[Debugging JIT compiled code with GDB](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/troubleshoot.html?highlight=numba_opt#debugging-jit-compiled-code-with-gdb).

### Requirements

Intel® Distribution for GDB is needed for `numba-dppy`'s debugging features
to work. Intel® Distribution for GDB is part of Intel oneApi and the relevant
documentation can be found at
[Intel® Distribution for GDB documentation](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/distribution-for-gdb.html).

### Example of GDB usage

```bash
$ export NUMBA_DPPY_DEBUG=True
$ gdb-oneapi -q python
(gdb) break numba_dppy/examples/sum.py:14  # Assumes the kernel is in file sum.py, at line 14
(gdb) run sum.py
```

For example, given the following `numba-dppy` kernel code:
```python
import numpy as np
import numba_dppy as dppy
import dpctl

@dppy.kernel
def data_parallel_sum(a, b, c):
    i = dppy.get_global_id(0)
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i]

global_size = 10
N = global_size

a = np.array(np.random.random(N), dtype=np.float32)
b = np.array(np.random.random(N), dtype=np.float32)
c = np.ones_like(a)

with dpctl.device_context("opencl:gpu") as gpu_queue:
    data_parallel_sum[global_size, dppy.DEFAULT_LOCAL_SIZE](a, b, c)
```

**GDB output**:
```bash
Thread 2.2 hit Breakpoint 1,  with SIMD lanes [0-7], dppl_py_devfn__5F__5F_main_5F__5F__2E_data_5F_parallel_5F_sum_24_1_2E_array_28_float32_2C__20_1d_2C__20_C_29__2E_array_28_float32_2C__20_1d_2C__20_C_29__2E_array_28_float32_2C__20_1d_2C__20_C_29_ () at sum.py:14
14          i = dppy.get_global_id(0)
(gdb)
(gdb) n  # Making step
15          c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
```

### Limitations

Currently, `numba-dppy` provides only initial support of debugging SYCL kernels.
The following functionalities are **not supported** :
- Printing kernel local variables (e.g. ```info locals```).
- Stepping over several offloaded functions.
