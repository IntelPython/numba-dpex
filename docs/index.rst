Welcome to Numba-dppy's documentation!
======================================

`Numba-dppy <https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dppy>`_ is a standalone extension to the `Numba
<https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ JIT compiler that adds `SYCL
<https://www.khronos.org/sycl/>`_ programming capabilities to Numba.
Numba-dppy uses `dpctl <https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl>`_ to support
SYCL features and currently Intel's `DPC++ <https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/GetStartedGuide.md>`_ is the only SYCL runtime supported by
Numba-dppy.

There are two ways to program SYCL devices using Numba-dppy:

  - An explicit kernel programming mode.

    .. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        import numba_dppy, numba_dppy as dppy
        import dpctl

        @dppy.kernel
            def sum(a, b, c):
            i = dppy.get_global_id(0)
            c[i] = a[i] + b[i]

        a = np.array(np.random.random(20), dtype=np.float32)
        b = np.array(np.random.random(20), dtype=np.float32)
        c = np.ones_like(a)

        with dpctl.device_context("opencl:gpu"):
            sum[20, dppy.DEFAULT_LOCAL_SIZE](a, b, c)

  - An automatic offload mode for NumPy data-parallel expressions and
    `Numba parallel loops <https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/parallel.html#explicit-parallel-loops>`_.

    .. code-block:: python

        from numba import njit
        import numpy as np
        import dpctl

        @njit
        def f1(a, b):
            c = a + b
            return c

        global_size = 64
        local_size = 32
        N = global_size * local_size
        a = np.ones(N, dtype=np.float32)
        b = np.ones(N, dtype=np.float32)
        with dpctl.device_context("opencl:gpu:0"):
            c = f1(a, b)
