Data Parallel Extension for Numba*
==================================

Numba-dpex is an open-source kernel-programming API and JIT compiler for
portable accelerator programming directly in Python. The API and the compiler is
modeled after the C++ SYCL* language and brings a similar programming model and
language design to Python. The page lists the relevant documentation to learn to
program data-parallel kernels using numba-dpex.
