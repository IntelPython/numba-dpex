numba_dppy can run several of the numpy.random RNG functions called inside
a JIT function on a SYCL device using dpnp
(https://github.com/IntelPython/dpnp). As with the rest of numba_dppy examples,
this feature is also available by simply invoking a ``numba.jit`` function with
the numpy.random calls from within a ``dpctl.device_context``scope.
