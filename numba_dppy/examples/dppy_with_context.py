"""
The numba_dppy extension adds an automatic offload optimizer to
numba. The optimizer automatically detects data-parallel code
regions in a numba.jit function and then offloads the data-parallel
regions to a SYCL device. The optimizer is triggered when a numba.jit
function is invoked inside a dpctl ``device_context`` scope.

This example demonstrates the usage of numba_dppy's automatic offload
functionality. Note that numba_dppy should be installed in your
environment for the example to work.
