    The example demonstrates the use of numba_dppy's ``atomic_add`` intrinsic
    function on a SYCL GPU device. The ``dpctl.select_gpu_device`` is
    equivalent to ``sycl::gpu_selector`` and returns a sycl::device of type GPU.

    If we want to generate native floating point atomics for spported
    SYCL devices we need to set two environment variables:
    NUMBA_DPPY_ACTIVATE_ATOMCIS_FP_NATIVE=1
    NUMBA_DPPY_LLVM_SPIRV_ROOT=/path/to/dpcpp/provided/llvm_spirv

    To run this example:
    NUMBA_DPPY_ACTIVATE_ATOMCIS_FP_NATIVE=1 NUMBA_DPPY_LLVM_SPIRV_ROOT=/path/to/dpcpp/provided/llvm_spirv python atomic_op.py

    Without these two environment variables Numba_dppy will use other
    implementation for floating point atomics.
